Learning to Git

This is an edit to the README I'm using to understand how to use Git.

The master "branch" is, quite literally the master copy. Other branches such as "readme-edits" are the in progress changes that are being made. 

Branches are copies of a file. The master is exactly that: a master. Subsequent branches are "works in progress". 

If I want to make changes to code for a side project or edit I would create a new branch! 

For example: Weather Station Power Monitoring with the INA219 might be a "INA219" branch. 

This sort of file I would like to keep eventually so I need to figure out how to make it it's own repository eventually.
